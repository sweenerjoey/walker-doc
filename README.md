# Discover the untold story of the only woman awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.

Produced in partnership with the Oswego County Historical Society, _Courage and Conviction: Dr Mary Walker's War_ is the first feature-length documentary to fully chronicle the life of Dr. Mary Edwards Walker (1832–1919), Civil War surgeon and only female Medal of Honor recipient. **Now in pre-production.**

The film will trace Walker’s path through her formative childhood in Oswego County, to her tireless fight for an Army commission during the Civil War and her decades-long advocacy for women’s suffrage and dress reform. It will also examine her legacy and the ongoing, contested struggle around her memory. A film by Shane Johnson and Twilight Town Productions.
